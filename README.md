Topic 5 - Integration of geospatial user feedback applied to data resources (quality, fit for purpose)

The objective of this hands on is to illustrate how to include the Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) mechanims in community catalogues. We will simulate the existance of a catalogue that we can manipulate using the corine.htm (extracted from the copernicus land service: https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc-2012?tab=metadata). The corine.htm page represents a resource that we have discovered in a catalogue and we want to be able to provide feedback about it. Do be able to do that, we will add the GUF widget using the procedure indicated in the instructions provided en the NiMMBus GitHub page. Note that the two first entries are the code and the codespace that we need to link the metadata (and the data) to the GUF.

General information about the GUF can be found in [the nimmbus GitHub](/joanma747/nimmbus)

The instructions to integrate the GUF can be found in [the nimmbus integration GitHub page](/joanma747/nimmbus/tree/master/GUF_integration)
